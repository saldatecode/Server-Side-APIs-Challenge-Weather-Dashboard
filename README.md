# Weather-Dashboard

## Discription

### Challenge 6 required I create a weather dash board that would provide a 5 day forcast. The user can enter the name of a city, it will then match the weather to the city designated in the search bar.

### If no city is found it will alert the user. Every time the user searches for a city, the data will be stored and can be reused.
